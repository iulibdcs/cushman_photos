## Overview

The Charles W. Cushman Photograph Collection, initially published in
late 2003 by the Indiana University Libraries in partnership with the
Indiana University Archives, is one of our most visited digital special collections, with nearly
nine million _unique_ hits to date.  Charles Cushman, amateur photographer and
Indiana University alumnus, is regarded for his early adoption of
Kodachrome color slides and his depiction of every day life, between
1938-1968, in the United States and abroad.  An Institute of Museum and Library 
Services (IMLS) National Leadership Grant in 2000 funded the digitization and online publication of
Cushman’s unknown yet spectacular photographs that amounted to nearly
14,500 35mm slides.  

Once released to the public, Cushman captivated the masses and impacted scholarship.  
Professor Eric Sandweiss, Carmony Chair of Indiana University Bloomington’s History
Department, published articles and, more recently, a book analyzing
Cushman’s photographs, <a href="http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199772339.do">_The Day in Its Color_</a>, 
and heavily used the online collection to further
his research.   The collection was also used in unexpected and creative
ways.  It inspired individuals blogging personal histories, writing
fictional stories around photographic themes, and modern day
photographers replicating and juxtaposing current day images of
buildings and sites with those depicted in Cushman’s original
photographs.   The worldwide press coverage was unanticipated and has
included a home page feature on the 
<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2036932/New-York-City-photos-Charles-W-Cushman-reveal-1940s-life-Big-Apple.html">Daily Mail</a> and a story on
<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2011/09/1940s-color-photographs-of-new-york-city/">ABC News</a>, both published as recently as September 2011, 
<a href="http://www.npr.org/news/specials/2012/cushman/">NPR's Picture Show</a> in 2012, and more.

## Metadata

Recently, we were contacted by <a href="https://twitter.com/@jonvoss">Jon Voss</a> 
from <a href="http://www.historypin.com">HistoryPin</a> who had heard of our Cushman Collection
and was keen on integrating all or parts of the collection into HistoryPin.  Developed by 
the NFP, <a href="http://www.wearewhatwedo.org/">We Are What We Do</a>, in 
<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/03/google-and-historypin-launch-online.html">partnership with Google</a>,
HistoryPin is a community-driven, collaborative digital history project that exposes our global cultural heritage, 
with an emphasis on place and space, via a platform that's conducive to mapping (or "pinning"), storytelling, 
and crowdsourcing our collective knowledge.

As indicated above, the Cushman photos are a mesmerizing slice of life, time and space that
has already captured the interests of so many people.  The Cushman collection
is an ideal contribution to HistoryPin, and we are, in turn, eager to share the Cushman Collection 
more broadly and benefit from the collective, communal knowledge.  

To this end, though others interested in the Cushman metadata are welcome to it (see Terms of Use below),
we include in this repository a CSV file of 15,190 rows of metadata, 14,425 records of which are currently published in
the <a href="http://dlib.indiana.edu/collections/cushman/">Charles W. Cushman Photograph Collection</a>.  This
collection is <a href="http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/cushman/projectInfo/catalogInfo.jsp">richly described</a> with
every record containing geographic location information, at a minimum, at the city level.

Once Jon and his team parse through the metadata, we will announce next steps which hopefully will
include an unveiling of all or some of the Cushman Collection in HistoryPin as a tour or channel.
