## Overview

The <a
href="http://dlib.indiana.edu/collections/cushman/">Charles W. Cushman Photograph Collection</a>, initially published in
late 2003 by the Indiana University Libraries in partnership with the
Indiana University Archives, is one of our most visited digital special collections, with nearly
nine million hits to date.  Charles Cushman, amateur photographer and
Indiana University alumnus, is regarded for his early adoption of
Kodachrome color slides and his depiction of every day life, between
1938-1968, in the United States and abroad.  An Institute of Museum and Library 
Services (IMLS) National Leadership Grant in 2000 funded the digitization and online publication of
Cushman’s unknown yet spectacular photographs that amounted to nearly
14,500 35mm slides available on the web site.  

Once released to the public, Cushman captivated the masses and impacted scholarship,
in unanticipated ways. Professor Eric Sandweiss, Carmony Chair of Indiana University Bloomington’s History
Department, published articles and, more recently, a book analyzing
Cushman’s photographs, <a href="http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199772339.do">_The Day in Its Color_</a>, 
and heavily used the online collection to further
his research.   The collection was also used in creative
ways.  It inspired individuals to blog personal histories, write
fictional stories around photographic themes, and modern day
photographers to replicate and juxtapose current day images of
buildings and sites with those depicted in Cushman’s original
photographs.   The worldwide press coverage was unanticipated and has
included a home page feature on the 
<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2036932/New-York-City-photos-Charles-W-Cushman-reveal-1940s-life-Big-Apple.html">Daily Mail</a> and a story on
<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2011/09/1940s-color-photographs-of-new-york-city/">ABC News</a>, both published as recently as September 2011, 
<a href="http://www.npr.org/news/specials/2012/cushman/">NPR's Picture Show</a> in 2012, and more.

## Metadata

Recently, we were contacted by <a href="https://twitter.com/@jonvoss">Jon Voss</a> 
from <a href="http://www.historypin.com">HistoryPin</a> who had heard of our Cushman Collection
and was keen on integrating all or parts of the collection into HistoryPin.  Developed by 
the Non-For-Profit, <a href="http://www.wearewhatwedo.org/">We Are What We Do</a>, in 
<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/03/google-and-historypin-launch-online.html">partnership with Google</a>,
HistoryPin is a community-driven, collaborative digital history project that exposes our global cultural heritage, 
with an emphasis on place and space, via a platform that's conducive to mapping (or "pinning"), storytelling, 
and crowdsourcing our collective history.

As indicated above, the Cushman photos are a mesmerizing slice of life that
has already captured the interests of so many people.  The Cushman collection
is an ideal contribution to HistoryPin, and we are, in turn, eager to share the Cushman Collection 
more broadly and benefit from the collective knowledge of HistoryPin users.  

To this end, though others interested in the Cushman metadata are welcome to it,
we include in this repository a CSV file of 15,190 rows of metadata, 14,425 records of which are currently published in
the <a href="http://dlib.indiana.edu/collections/cushman/">Charles W. Cushman Photograph Collection</a>.  The
collection is <a href="http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/cushman/projectInfo/catalogInfo.jsp">richly described</a> with
every record containing geographic location information, at a minimum, at the city level.  The following
controlled vocabularies were used:

* <a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/">Getty Thesauraus of Geographic Names</a> (TGN): Neighborhood, City, State, Country
* Library of Congress Thesauri for Graphic Materials, <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/print/tgm1/">Subject Terms (TGM I)</a>: Topical Subject
* Library of Congress Thesauri for Graphic Materials, <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/print/tgm2/">Genre and Physical Characteristic Terms (TGM II)</a>: Genre
* Library of Congress Authorities Files (<a href="http://authorities.loc.gov/">LCAF</a>): Personal names, places (not in TGN), subjects (not in TGM I)

Cushman metadata is also available via OAI-PMH, which provides additional information like which
controlled vocabularies or encodings were used:
